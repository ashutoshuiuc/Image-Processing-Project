This repository contains the homeowkr solutions and course project for Image Processing CS663 at IIT Bombay. Our course project is on Deblurring and 
Denoising Images using Reverse Heat Equation.
We have implemented Iterative Reverse and Forward Mean Shift Algorithms on multidimensional image clusters and integrated normal component
of heat equation for stability, achieving 13% PSNR improvement.
